    <h1>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h1>

    <p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) content. While HTML structures and defines the content of a web page using elements like headings, paragraphs, and images, CSS applies styles to these elements, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. </p>
    <p>By separating content (HTML) from design (CSS), developers can maintain and update the visual appearance of a website more efficiently, ensuring a consistent look and feel across multiple pages while keeping the HTML code clean and focused on structure.</p>

        We can style using div , in line (inside the opening tags) as we have seen before. CSS property can be applied for specific needs this way. But, that can be redundant for longer html documents with lots of lines of code. 
        <br>
        The preferred way to do it externally. To write CSS code on a seperate style.css file.
        <br>
        and then the html documents can get those styling properties with a line of code which tells that respective html document that it wants to be related to that css styling file.
        <br>
        multiple html long documents can get the consistent styling by the link command which is:
        <br>
        &lt;link rel = "stylesheet" href = "style.css"&gt;, obviously include this within the head tag and not anywhere else. Because head tags serve the purpose of having meta information, scripts for javascript, styling for css, titles and other related information.
