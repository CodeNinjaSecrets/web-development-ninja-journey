    <h1>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>What is CSS, How does it Relate to HTML...</h2>

    <p> <i>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</i> is used to control the presentation of <i>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</i> content. While <i>HTML</i> structures and defines the content of a web page using elements like headings, paragraphs, and images, <i>CSS</i> applies styles to these elements, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. </p>
    <p>By separating <i>(content) HTML from design (CSS)</i>, developers can maintain and update the visual appearance of a website more efficiently, ensuring a consistent look and feel across multiple pages while keeping the <i>HTML</i> code clean and focused on structure.</p>

<h2>How to apply it to HTML....</h2>


        We can style using <i><b>&lt;div&gt; ,&lt;span&gt;, in-line</b> tags</b> (inside the opening tags)</i> as we have seen before. css property can be applied for specific needs this way. But, that can be redundant for longer html documents with lots of lines of code.

        <br>
        The preferred way to do it externally. <ins>To write <i>css</i> code on a seperate style.css file.</ins>
        <br>
        
        and then the <i>html</i> documents can get those styling properties with a line of code which tells that respective <i>html</i> document that it wants to be related to that <i>css</i> styling file.
        <br>
        <br>
        Multiple <i><b>html</b></i> documents can achieve consistent styling by using the &lt;link&gt; element to connect them to a single <i>CSS</i> file.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style = "background-color: rgb(255, 81, 0)"><b>&lt;link rel = "stylesheet" href = "style.css"&gt; </b></span>  <br>  <br> Obviously include this within the head tag and not anywhere else. Because head tags serve the purpose of having meta information, scripts for javascript, styling for css, titles and other related information.
