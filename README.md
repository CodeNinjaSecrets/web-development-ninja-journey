# HTML & CSS Learning  

Just a simple repository where I practice **HTML and CSS**. Nothing fancyâ€”just experimenting and learning the basics. I'll add more as I improve.  

## How to Use  
- Clone the repo and open the files in a browser.  
- Feel free to explore or suggest improvements!  

More to come soon! ðŸš€
