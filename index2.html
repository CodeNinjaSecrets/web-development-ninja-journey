    &lt;hr&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Websites today are an important digital platform for communication, displaying information to a global audience. Websites are comprised of multiple webpage elements such as text, images, links... A webpage is technically an HTML document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Why are you here on this webpage&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get to know about web design and how they are developed here ;)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We will briefly cover the basic fundamental web technologies: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. These three are primarily used to create interactive websites....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let's learn some fundamental concepts to be understood before we get to the computing languages. Click on the link below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;a href="index2.html" target="_blank" title="This will take you to another webpage"&gt;

  Each of the text inputted in between, these
  will be displayed visually different depending on the 'tags' </p>

   <h3>"How to Display Code as Text Without It Being Interpreted as HTML Code"</h3>
   <br>
  <p>When you want to display HTML, or any code snippet on a webpage as text (not interpreted as HTML), 
   you need to replace the angle brackets of the tags(< and >) in your code as entities &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;.
    This prevents the browser from interpreting them as opening and closing HTML tags.
    
    <!-- &amp is amp amp-->
    <!--&amp;amp;lt; and &amp;amp;gt;-->
