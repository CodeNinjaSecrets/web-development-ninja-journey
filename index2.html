    and sometimes important announcements or featured content. 
    It sets the tone and structure for the rest of the website, making it a crucial part of the user experience.

   <hr>
<div>

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Learn to Build Stunning Websites!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Websites today are an important digital platform for communication, displaying information to a global audience. Websites are comprised of multiple webpage elements such as text, images, links... A webpage is technically an HTML document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Why are you here on this webpage&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get to know about web design and how they are developed here ;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Learning Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will briefly cover the basic fundamental web technologies: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. These three are primarily used to create interactive websites....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let's learn some fundamental concepts to be understood before we get to the computing languages. Click on the link below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;a href="index2.html" target="_blank" title="This will take you to another webpage"&gt;
      Click here
    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<div>

<hr>     

 <p> Text can be written inside this &lt;h1&gt;....text...&lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;..txt....&lt;h2&gt;,&lt;/h3&gt;...&lt;/h3&gt;,&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt; and etc...
  Each of the text inputted in between, these
  will be displayed visually different depending on the 'tags' </p>
  <br>
   <h3>"How to Display Code as Text Without It Being Interpreted as HTML Code"</h3>
   <br>
  <p>When you want to display HTML, or any code snippet on a webpage as text (not interpreted as HTML), 
   you need to replace the angle brackets of the tags(< and >) in your code as entities &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;.
    This prevents the browser from interpreting them as opening and closing HTML tags.
    
    <!-- &amp is amp amp-->
    <!--&amp;amp;lt; and &amp;amp;gt;-->

   
   </p>

<span >
<br>
The &lt;code&gt; tags in HTML are used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside these tags is typically displayed in a monospace font, which distinguishes it from other text. This is useful for presenting code snippets or commands within a webpage.

  </span>
  <p class = "pagination">
    <a href = "index.html"><</a>
    <a href = "index2.html" class = "active">2</a>
    <a href = "index3.html" >3</a>
    <a href = "index4.html">4</a>
    <a href = "index5.html">5</a>
    <a href = "index6.html" >6</a>
    <a href = "index7.html" >7</a>
    <a href = "index8.html" >8</a>
    <a href = "index9.html">9</a>
