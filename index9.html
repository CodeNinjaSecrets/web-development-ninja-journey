    <title>Web Layout and Float</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Web Layout</h2>
<p>
    Even though it is up to personal preference, the common website layout/format is as follows:
</p>

<h2>Header:</h2>
<p>
    The header is typically the top section of a webpage. <br>
    It often contains the website's logo, title, and navigation links. <br>
    Think of it as the area that introduces the site and gives users their first impression.
</p>

<h2>Navigation (Nav):</h2>
<p>
    This section provides links to the main parts of the website. <br>
    It helps users find their way around the site easily. <br>
    The nav element usually contains a list of links organized in a menu format.
</p>

<h2>Main Content:</h2>
<p>
    This is the primary area where the main content of the webpage is displayed. <br>
    It can include several subsections:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Section:</strong> A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. It's like a chapter in a book.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Article:</strong> An article is a self-contained piece of content that can stand alone. It could be a blog post, news article, or any independent content item.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Aside:</strong> The aside element contains content that is tangentially related to the main content. It’s often used for sidebars, pull quotes, or additional information.
</p>

<h2>Footer:</h2>
<p>
    The footer is located at the bottom of the webpage. <br>
    It often contains copyright information, links to privacy policies, contact details, and sometimes additional navigation links. <br>
    Think of it as the closing section that wraps up the webpage.
</p>

<h2>Visual Layout Example:</h2>
<p>

    <img src = "web layout.png" height = "400px" width = "600";>
</p>

<p>
    Developers frequently use the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to organize their code into different sections. The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element can also be used in CSS for positioning these sections. However, using too many <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements can make the code difficult to read because <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> itself doesn’t provide much information about the content it contains.
</p>
<p>
    This is why semantic HTML tags are preferred for web layout. Semantic tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> give more meaning to the structure of the webpage. They describe the role of the content they contain, making the code more readable and understandable.
</p>

<h2>What is Float?</h2>
<p>
    In short, the float property in CSS is used to position elements horizontally on a webpage, as if they are "floating" to the left or right within their containing element. It allows text and inline elements to wrap around the floated element, creating various layout possibilities.
</p>
<p>
    Here's a simple explanation and code sample:
    <br>
    <br>
    The article, section, and aside elements on this webpage of which each have implemented float: <code>float: left;</code>
</p>

<h2>Why We Use Float:</h2>
<p>
    To position elements side by side, such as images and text. <br>
    To create multi-column layouts. <br>
    To wrap text around images or other elements.
