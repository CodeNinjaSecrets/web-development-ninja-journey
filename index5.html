<h2>What is Git?</h2>

Git tracks changes, helps developers collaborate, and manage code efficiently, essential for teamwork and showcasing projects on GitHub.

<h3>Developers Experience (DevX)</h3>
<p>What is the developer experience process?
  Developer experience (DevEx) refers to the technology, processes and culture that define software development in an organization. It describes how well an engineering culture incentivizes quality work, and how easy it is to get things done.</p>
<br>
<br>

  Git is used for managing code history and collaborating with other developers, enabling efficient version control and team coordination. GitHub is an open-source platform for hosting web applications as projects, facilitating collaborative development, code sharing, and community engagement.

<h1>How to use it</h1>


<br>

For simplicity, we are using bash language, in bash shell.


<br>
<div style = "background-color: rgba(245, 245, 245, 0.71)">
<dl>

  <dt>Make sure we are in the home directory by using command:</dl>
   <b> <dd>cd ~
    </dd></b>
    <br>
    <br>

  
<dt>We use this command to clone (create a copy of) others or our own folder into our local machine from GitHub which has the folder aka repos:</dt>
<b><dd>git clone "url_from_github"
</dd></b>
<br>
<br>

<dt>We move into that folder by using:</dt>
<b><dd>cd repo_name_that_is_saved_in_our_machine
</dd></b>
<br>
<br>

<dt>We can then see the folder's content. So, we then use:</dt>
<b><dd>code file_name
</dd></b>
to create or open a file for writing our code in it.
<br>
<br>

<dt>To add this file into GitHub, we must first add the file to a staging area:</dt>
<b><dd>git add file_name
</dd></b>
<br>
<br>

<dt>Then create a snapshot of it with:</dt>
<b><dd>git commit -m "enter message for snapshot"
</dd></b>
<br>
<br>

<dt>Then to push this code finally to GitHub we use:</dt>
<b><dd>git push origin main
</dd></b>
<br>
<br>

<dt>After making changes to our code we can use:</dt>
<b><dd>git status
</dd></b>
to see if we have added, committed, and pushed our changes to GitHub.
<br>
<br>

<dt>So far we are working with pushing files to GitHub via Git commands. Now, a scenario where we made a mistake or we want to see our code history, Git comes in clutch. We use:</dt>
<b><dd>git log
</dd></b>
to see the history of our Git commits aka snapshots, to know the exact code changes in that commit.
<br>
<br>

<dt>Each commit/snapshot contains a hash code. We use:
  </dt>
<b><dd>git show hashcode_of_that_commit
</dd></b>
to see the code details of that specific commit.
<br>
<br>

<dt>Now we can choose to reset and go back to our code that was written with our commit as well, this is one of the great reasons for Git. We use these two commands:</dt>
<b><dd>git reset --hard hashcode
</dd></b>

<dt>and then follow it with:</dt>
<b><dd>git push origin main --force
</dd></b>
for going back to that snapshot.
<br>
<br>

<dt>We are by default working with the <ins>master branch</ins> (in other words: default main branch). Developers working in a team, can sometimes dive into another branch within the same project that they are working on, & then later merge it with the master branch.</dt>
<br>

<b><dd>git checkout branch_name</dd></b>
<p>Branches serve the ability to work independently.</p>
<br>

<dt>After you add, commit, push changes to your branch in order to <ins>grab the changes made in the branch and merge it with your branch you do the command:</ins> </dt>
<b><dd>git pull origin master</dd></b>
<br>
<br>

<dt>Then finally make a pull request on github UI interface:</dt>
<b>
<dd><button>pull request</button>(on the web interface)
</dd></b>
These output request changes will merge with the master branch correctly with no merge conflicts.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Should you do "git pull origin master" before making a "pull request" ?</h3>

<p><h4>Yes!</h4>You should generally do "git pull origin master" before making a pull request.</p>

<h4>Why?</h4>
Helps ensure that your branch is up-to-date, reduces the risk of merge conflicts
