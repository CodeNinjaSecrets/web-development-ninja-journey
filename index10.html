    <h2>Programming Paradigms</h2><h3>Functional Programming vs Object Oriented Programming</h3>
    <p>FP focuses on functions and their inputs and outputs. OOP is based on the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. FP is based on the principles of immutability, referential transparency, higher-order functions, and recursion</p>

    <h2>Should we approach Javascript as an FP or OOP language?</h2>
    <p>Javascript is a functional programming language. The level of the sophistication of
        all the code you’ll ever write in JavaScript hinges upon this realization. Java on the other hand is a non-functional programming language.</p>

      <p>Both Hamburger and Ham have meat in them, likewise both Java and Javascript are programming languages that have a <a href = "" title = "C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Perl all have a C-influenced syntax">C-influenced syntax.<a></p>
        <p>The single most important weapon to yield from Javascript is understanding functions in depth.</p>
